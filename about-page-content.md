# About TestLoop Labs

## Our Story

TestLoop Labs began at the intersection of two passions: building exceptional product experiences and exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence.

After leading product teams at companies like Spotify, Airbnb, and Shopify for over 15 years, I found myself repeatedly solving the same fundamental challenges across organizations:

- How do you systematically identify what users actually need (not just what they say they want)?
- How do you build a culture of experimentation that drives real growth?
- How do you translate customer insights into products people love?
- How do you balance innovation with execution?

In 2018, I began consulting with startups and growth-stage companies to implement the methodologies I'd developed—combining behavioral science, data-driven experimentation, and product-led growth strategies. The results were transformative, with clients seeing an average 3.5x improvement in key metrics within six months.

But consulting alone wasn't enough. I wanted to demonstrate these principles in action through real products that solved meaningful problems.

In 2020, TestLoop Labs evolved into its current form: a product management consultancy that also builds AI-powered tools that embody our product principles. This dual approach creates a virtuous cycle—our consulting informs the tools we build, and our tools demonstrate the methodologies we teach.

## Our Philosophy

At TestLoop Labs, we operate on four core beliefs:

### 1. The Best Products Emerge from Systematic Experimentation

Great products aren't built on grand visions alone—they're the result of disciplined hypothesis testing and iteration. We believe in the power of small, incremental experiments that compound into significant outcomes.

Our A/B testing methodology has been refined through over 2,000 experiments across multiple industries, helping clients develop internal capabilities that transform how they build products.

### 2. Behavioral Science Is the Foundation of Exceptional User Experiences

Understanding human psychology is essential to building products people love. By applying principles from behavioral economics and cognitive psychology, we design experiences that align with how people actually make decisions—not how we think they should.

Our behavioral framework incorporates concepts like loss aversion, cognitive load theory, and social proof to create products that feel intuitive and compelling.

### 3. Growth Comes from Product Value, Not Marketing Tricks

Sustainable growth comes from creating genuine user value, not growth hacks or marketing gimmicks. By focusing on a product's core value proposition and removing friction from the user journey, we help companies build self-sustaining growth engines.

Our product-led growth methodology has helped companies reduce customer acquisition costs by an average of 47% while accelerating revenue growth.

### 4. AI Should Augment Human Capabilities, Not Replace Them

We believe in building AI tools that enhance human capabilities rather than replacing them. Our tools focus on eliminating repetitive tasks, surfacing insights humans might miss, and creating leverage for skilled professionals.

This philosophy guides both our consulting approach and the AI products we develop, ensuring technology serves human needs rather than the other way around.
